2. Paste the contents of `CasinoToken.sol` and `CasinoGame.sol` into new files
3. Compile both contracts using the Solidity compiler
4. In the **Deploy & Run Transactions** panel:
   - Environment: **Injected Provider - MetaMask** (connect your wallet)
   - Contract: Select `CasinoToken`
   - Constructor parameter: Enter your wallet address for ownership
   - Deploy and copy the deployed address
5. Repeat for `CasinoGame` contract, passing the `CasinoToken` address as constructor argument
